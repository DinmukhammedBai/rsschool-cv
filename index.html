        <h2 class="1234">Briefly about yourself:</h2>
        <p>When I start one thing, I try my best to finish it.
            I myself was intrigued by this direction and, after studying it, realized that this profession is mine.
            And in this profession I need to study a lot and work a lot in practice.
        </p>
        <p>And a lot of searching to find out new information I like, and I can quickly understand the information I
            got.
            I am studying at the university myself, majoring in Information Technology within an Information System.
            I am interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional
            growth,
            in addition, there are a huge number of free high-quality resources for self-education and a large community
            of developers.
            I am sure that in the future I will become a strong specialist in this profession, that is, a Frontend
            developer.
        </p>
